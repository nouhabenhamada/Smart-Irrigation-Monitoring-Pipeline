## **Project Overview**  
The pipeline processes sensor data in real-time, applies machine learning models for predictions, and leverages advanced AI for data interpretation. The insights are visualized on a dashboard for actionable decision-making.  

### **Key Features**:  
- **IoT Data Integration**: Collects data from sensors.  
- **Real-Time Processing**: Utilizes Kafka and AWS Kinesis for seamless data streaming.  
- **Machine Learning**: Employs Amazon SageMaker for training and predictions.  
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Azure OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo provides meaningful interpretations.  
- **Data Visualization**: Grafana displays real-time dashboards powered by Athena queries.  

---

## **Pipeline Workflow**  

1. **Sensor Data Generation**:  
   - Simulated sensor data is generated using a Python script and sent to a Kafka consumer.  

2. **Kafka Stream**:  
   - Sensor data enters a Kafka topic and is forwarded to a Kafka producer.  

3. **Amazon Kinesis Data Stream**:  
   - Kafka producer sends the data to Amazon Kinesis for streaming into the pipeline.  

4. **AWS Lambda Function**:  
   - **Trigger**: The Lambda function is triggered by the incoming data from Kinesis.  
   - **Processing**: The function applies a pre-trained machine learning model (stored in Amazon S3).  
   - **Predictions**: Predictions are saved back into Amazon S3.  

5. **Model Training** (Amazon SageMaker):  
   - Sensor data is used to train the machine learning model in Amazon SageMaker.  
   - The trained model is stored in Amazon S3.  

6. **Data Interpretation** (Azure OpenAI):  
   - Predictions saved in S3 are sent to the Azure OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model.  
   - The model interprets the predictions and generates insights, which are then saved back into Amazon S3.  

7. **Data Structuring and Storage** (AWS Glue):  
   - AWS Glue crawlers organize the data into a structured table.  
   - The table is stored in AWS Glue Data Catalog.  

8. **Querying with Athena**:  
   - AWS Athena queries the structured data for analysis.  

9. **Visualization with Grafana**:  
   - NGINX hosts the Grafana web server.  
   - Grafana queries Athena and visualizes the data on interactive dashboards.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **AWS Services**: Kinesis, Lambda, SageMaker, S3, Glue, Athena  
- **Azure OpenAI**: GPT-3.5 Turbo for data interpretation  
- **Kafka**: For real-time data streaming  
- **Grafana**: For dashboard visualization  
- **NGINX**: To host the web server  
- **IoT Simulated Data**: Python script to generate sensor data
